Riskr ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our decentralized application (dApp) built on the Solana blockchain.

## 1. Information We Collect

We prioritize your anonymity. We do not collect your real name, email address, phone number, or physical address.

* **Wallet Address:** We collect your public Solana wallet address to identify your account, track your staking status, and distribute rewards.
* **Usage Data:** We verify your wake-up time based on your device's interaction with the blockchain and our server timestamps.
* **Device Information:** We may collect basic device information necessary for the Android app to function (e.g., alarm permissions, network connectivity).

## 2. How We Use Your Information

* To execute the core game mechanics: Staking, Verifying, and Slashing/Rewarding.
* To maintain a leaderboard of user streaks (pseudonymous).
* To prevent cheating and ensure fair play.

## 3. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services which may process your data:
* **Google Firebase:** Used for storing user profiles (Wallet Address + Username) and leaderboard data.
* **Solana Blockchain:** All transactions (Staking, Refunding) are public records on the Solana blockchain.
* **Render:** Used to host our backend verification logic.

## 4. Financial Disclaimer & Risk

**Riskr involves real financial risk.** By using this app, you acknowledge that:
* You must stake SKR tokens to participate.
* **If you fail to verify within the designated time window (08:00 AM - 08:02 AM), your staked tokens will be slashed (lost) and sent to the prize pool.**
* We are not responsible for funds lost due to user error, network latency, Solana blockchain outages, or third-party wallet malfunctions.
