RISKR Privacy Policy

1. Data Collection
   RISKR is a fully decentralized application (dApp). We do not collect, store, or process any personal information (such as names, emails, or phone numbers). No account registration is required.

2. Wallet Data
   To function, the app interacts with your Solana wallet. We only read your public wallet address and SKR token balance to facilitate gameplay. We do not have access to your private keys or recovery phrases.

3. Blockchain Transactions
   All game outcomes, bets, and token transfers are executed on the Solana blockchain. Please note that these transactions are public, immutable, and permanently recorded on the ledger.

4. Third-Party Services
   We use standard Solana RPC nodes to connect to the blockchain.
